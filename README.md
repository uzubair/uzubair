## About Me

After graduating from the University of Windsor's Computer Science program in the Spring of 2006,
I worked for various companies before landing at Miovision in November 2021. I've worked primarly
on web services with a focus on efficency, scalability, automated testing, and maintainability.

My interests include cloud computing, server-side development, software design patterns, and complex
algorithms.

In my spare time, I'm a son, a brother, a husband, and a lover of music and movies. I play with Lego,
video games on PS4 and spend far too much time on `reddit.com/r/programming`.
